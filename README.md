# KSM308 example statistics
This directory contains R code that analyses example data (univariate and multivariate), and runs through some examples of how to model and visualise your data.

- Notes to students: A well written question to stackoverflow will outperform asking chatGPT/copilot 99% of the time. Stackoverflow will make you think about what you're coding. AI language models are not at the stage yet where they can think for themselves, because of this, they often give you nonsense code (and hence results!), that you, nor the AI, knows what it means.
